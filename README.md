**RailFlow** is a full-stack data project simulating a high-volume European train booking platform (inspired by SNCF Connect). It ingests raw user logs, transforms them into business-ready models, deploys a Machine Learning model to predict booking probability, and activates data for marketing automation.

## 🎯 The Business Problem
**Context:** The Product Team at RailFlow noticed a gap between high search volume and low booking conversions on specific routes (e.g., Paris → Lyon).
**Goal:**
1.  **Visibility:** Create a trusted "Single Source of Truth" for revenue and search metrics.
2.  **Prediction:** Identify "High Intent" users in real-time who are likely to book but haven't yet.
3.  **Activation:** Automate marketing outreach (Push/Email) to those high-intent users to close the sale.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project follows the **Modern Data Stack** principles, moving from raw logs to activated data.



| Stage | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion** | Python (`Faker`, `Polars`) | Generating 10k+ realistic synthetic log rows with schema enforcement. |
| **Privacy** | Python (`hashlib`) | **GDPR Compliance:** SHA-256 hashing of PII (emails) before warehousing. |
| **Warehousing** | Google BigQuery | Serverless Data Warehouse located in `europe-west9` (Paris). |
| **Transformation** | dbt (Data Build Tool) | Modeling raw data into a Star Schema (`fct_daily_performance`, `dim_users`). |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-Learn | Random Forest Classifier to predict booking probability. |
| **Application** | Streamlit | Interactive web app for stakeholders to test the ML model. |
| **Reverse ETL** | Python | Syncing "High Churn Risk" segments to Marketing tools (simulated). |
| **Validation** | SciPy | A/B Testing statistical significance calculator. |

## 🚀 Project Phases

### 1. Data Engineering & GDPR Privacy
* **Data Generation:** Created complex synthetic datasets (`searches.csv`, `bookings.csv`, `users.csv`) mimicking real user behavior (e.g., lead times, price sensitivity).
* **Privacy Layer:** Implemented a pre-ingestion masking layer.
    * *Technique:* Emails are salted and hashed using **SHA-256** to ensure no raw PII enters the Data Warehouse.

### 2. Analytics Engineering (dbt)
Built a production-grade **Star Schema** to enable self-service BI.
* **Staging Models:** Cleaned raw BigQuery tables, casting timestamps and handling nulls.
* **Intermediate Models:** `int_search_bookings.sql` reconstructs the user funnel by joining searches to bookings.
* **Marts (Gold Layer):**
    * `fct_daily_performance`: Aggregated revenue, conversion rates, and search volume per route/day.
    * `dim_users`: User demographic dimensions.

### 3. Machine Learning (Prediction)
Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict `is_converted` (Booking Probability).
* **Features:** Origin, Destination, Lead Time (Days), Search Hour, Day of Week.
* **Performance:** The model identified that **Lead Time** is the #1 predictor of conversion.
* **Artifacts:** Exported model and label encoders as `railflow_brain.joblib` for deployment.

### 4. Data App (Streamlit)
Deployed a "Pricing Engine Simulator" allowing Product Managers to interact with the ML model.
* **Input:** User selects a route and travel date.
* **Output:** The app calculates a live probability score.
    * *Logic:* If Probability > 30% but < 70% (Medium Intent) → **Trigger 5% Discount**.



### 5. Product Analytics & A/B Testing
* **Tracking Plan:** Defined the schema for `search_route` and `ticket_purchased` events.
* **Experimentation:** Performed a Power Analysis to determine sample size (Required: ~86k users) and ran a Z-Test simulation to validate statistical significance of the discount feature.
* **Reverse ETL:** Wrote a script to query "High Churn Risk" users (Searched recently + No Booking) and generate a JSON payload for CRM tools (Braze/Salesforce).
