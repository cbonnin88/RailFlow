# ⚖️ Feature Prioritization (RICE Framework)

We evaluated 3 potential features for Q4. The **Smart Discount Engine** was selected as the winner.

### **The Formula**
$$RICE Score = \frac{(Reach \times Impact \times Confidence)}{Effort}$$

### **The Evaluation**

| Feature Idea | **R(each)**<br>(Users/Month) | **I(mpact)**<br>(1-3 Scale) | **C(onfidence)**<br>(%) | **E(ffort)**<br>(Person-Weeks) | **FINAL SCORE** | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Smart Discount Engine** | 100,000 | 3 (High) | 80% | 4 wks | **6,000** | ✅ **BUILD** |
| **Social Login (Google/FB)** | 100,000 | 1 (Low) | 90% | 2 wks | **4,500** | ⏸️ Backlog |
| **Carbon Footprint Calculator**| 100,000 | 0.5 (Min) | 100% | 3 wks | **1,666** | ❌ Kill |

### **Rationale**
1.  **Smart Discount Engine:** Although Effort is higher (4 weeks), the Revenue Impact (3) is massive compared to a simple UX tweak like Social Login.
2.  **Social Login:** Good for onboarding, but doesn't drive immediate revenue.
3.  **Carbon Calculator:** High user request, but low business impact. Deferred to Q1.
